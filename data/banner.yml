  Hello and welcome!  My name is Serban Simu - I am a tech entrepreneur in Berkeley, CA and I have made it my mission to help restore the natural world!

  My focus is the creation of a large natural reserve in the Carpathian mountains, in Romania. Europe has many national parks and they are all beautiful, but too small for natural processes and wildlife.  We have a unique chance to create a natural reserve almost the size of Yosemite in the Southern Carpathian mountains!

  I have joined forces with Foundation Carpathia and together we would like to introduce you to the Carpathia project.  Please join us Thursday May 11th at the David Brower Center in Berkeley for a short documentary, a discussion with the founders of Foundation Carpathia, followed by a cocktail hour!

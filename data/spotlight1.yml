  I grew up in Romania and studied computers and networks at the Polytechnic University in Bucharest and later ENST, France.  I jumped on a train every summer to hike the beautiful Carpathian mountains.  I moved to California in my late 20s where I co-founded Aspera in 2004 and Eluvio in 2018.  While I dedicate most minutes of every day to my work at Eluvio, I also focus on my passion-turned-mission to restore the natural environment and, part of that, youth development.
